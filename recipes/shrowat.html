    <h1>Shiro-Wat</h1>

    <h2>⭐ Origin Story</h2>
    <p>
        You'd have seen a note about this in some of my other Ethiopian recipes (like with this Atakilt Wat) Ethiopia
        (and Eritrea) have a large population of orthodox Christians, who fast (and cut out meat) for portions of the
        year. As a result, many Ethiopian meals have delicious vegan dishes that we can now thankfully enjoy.

    </p>
    <p> I learned the base for this recipe when I worked in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. I then adapted the
        recipe based on suggestions from a good (Ethiopian) friend's mother so you can make this easily in the US.</p>

    <p>Serves: 5 as a main course on its own, or up to 15 if served with other dishes, Ethiopian style</p>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <h4>Start by making shiro powder.</h4>
    <img src="../img/Shiro-Powder.jpg" alt="a Shiro-Powder" width="500" height="500">

    <ol>
        <li>
            Dry toast chickpea flour in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and slightly
            browned, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add berbere spice, ground cardamom, cumin powder, and garlic powder. Stir to combine and toast for an additional
            minute.
        </li>
        <li>Set aside. You can either add the salt here, or later</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>making the shiro</h4>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Heat a medium sized pot (or Dutch oven) on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and heat it up for a minute.</li>
        <li>Add a diced onion, and sauté over low to medium heat for a few minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>The smaller you can dice your onions the better. Alternatively, you can also puree the onions and add that instead!</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic along with tomato paste and sauté for a minute until garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the shiro powder, salt, and three cups of water to the pot.</li>
<li>Bring this to a boil on medium heat.</li>
<li>Turn the heat down and let the mixture simmer for 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the strength of your stove and the consistency you prefer.</li>
<li>Make sure to stir at five minute increments, so it doesn't stick.</li>
    </ol>
<p><em>pro tip!:</em>the olive oil will float to the top when the shiro is done cooking!</p>
<p>Serve hot with rice or injera </p>
